This folder is for the Unit Sphere: Convergence analysis.

transmission problem.ipynb: Generates the Galerkin BEM solution for precision_list = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
For precision==10, we plot the RCS (Fig. 3 (d)).

The far-fields are stored in results.

Therefore, the tensor solutions are assemblied in plots-transmission_problem.
We represent the convergence plots in Fig. 3.
